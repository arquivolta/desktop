# Arquivolta Desktop

Arquivolta Desktop is the installer for the [Arquivolta project](https://docs.arquivolta.dev)

(( Fill in a really nice screenshot here! ))

## Getting started with Development

The Arquivolta installer is a [Flutter application](https://flutter.dev). It is recommended but not required to use VS Code as your editor, since it's already configured in the project. To get started:

1. Install the latest version of Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition is fine), make sure that you install the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
1. Clone the repo
1. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. `./flutterw doctor` to make sure the Flutter SDK is set up properly
1. `./flutterw run -d windows` to start the app, or open the project in the editor
